# ML Algoritms from Scratch
This is a fun project where I learn to implement several ML algorithms from scratch in an effort to understand them more deeply.

Under `\src`, each algorithm folder contains the following:
- `notes.md` which contains any thoughts or learnings I had while writing the algoritms
- one or more `.py` files containing modules of the algorithm

My hope is that learning these will allow me to become a better engineer and be more familiar with the algorithms I use.
